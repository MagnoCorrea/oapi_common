== Scope

This document specifies an extension to the <<OAFeat-1,OGC API - Features -
Part 1: Core>> standard that defines the behaviour of a server that supports
multiple coordinates reference systems.

This document assumes that each supported coordinate reference system can be
referenced by a unique resource identifier (i.e. a URI).

Specifically, this document specifies:

* How, for each offered feature collection, a server advertises the list of supported coordinate reference system identifiers.

* How the coordinates of geometry valued feature properties can be accessed in one of the supported coordinate reference systems.

* How features can be accesses from the server using a bounding box specified in one of the supported coordinate reference systems.

* How a server can declare the coordinate reference system used to present
feature resources, and optionally the coordinate axis order used.
