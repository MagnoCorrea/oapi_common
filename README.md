# OGC API (OAPI) Common Specification

[OGC](http://opengeospatial.org) API standards define modular API building blocks to spatially enable Web APIs. The OGC API family of standards is organized by resource type. Each resource has an associated API standard. These resource-specific API standards share a common core. This OGC API Common standard specifies requirements which are shared by all OGC API standards. The OGC API Common standard is maintained on this GitHub repository.
