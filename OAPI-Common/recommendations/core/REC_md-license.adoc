^|*Recommendation {counter:rec-id}* |*/rec/core/md-license* 
^|A |For each resource collection in this distribution of the dataset, the `links` property of the collection SHOULD include an item for each supported encoding with a link to the collection resource (relation: `license`).

Alternatively, if all data shared via the API is available under the same license, the link MAY instead be added to the top-level `links` property of the response.

Multiple links to the license in different content types MAY be provided. At least a link to content type `text/html` or `text/plain` SHOULD be provided.
